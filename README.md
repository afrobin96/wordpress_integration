# Wordpress Integration #

This plugin enables automatic integration between Moodle and WordPress (with WooCommerce), facilitating the creation and enrollment of users in Moodle courses directly from purchases made in WordPress.
When a user purchases a course in WooCommerce, the WordPress site sends a request to Moodle via a secure web service (REST API).The plugin in Moodle receives this request, automatically creates the user (if they do not already exist), and enrolls them in the corresponding course.In this way, sales management and course access are carried out without manual intervention, improving the user experience and the efficiency of the educational process.


## Installing via uploaded ZIP file ##

1. Log in to your Moodle site as an admin and go to _Site administration >
   Plugins > Install plugins_.
2. Upload the ZIP file with the plugin code. You should only be prompted to add
   extra details if your plugin type is not automatically detected.
